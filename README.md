# Invidious-podman-LXC-VM
Simple repo for fast and automated deployment of local Invidious for Proxmox LXCs or VMs, utilizing podman.
Inspired by https://github.com/NapoleonWils0n/cerberus/blob/master/invidious/invidious-2025.org

## Instalation
Clone this repo (have git installed)...

Create a Debian 12+ based VM called "invidious" with:
* 4GB+ of RAM
* 2+ x86_64 cores, 4 is ideal (ARM is also possible but `compose.yml` has to be modified accordingly).
* 20+GB of storage

Or in a similar manner, create an unprivileged Debian 12+ based LXC "invidious" container.

Feel free to modify the `compose.yml` file when you know what you are doing and see it asfitting. 

Now you have to make your container have a static IP or configure a static lease on your router.

Further, you will need a DNS domain payed or local to point to this IP of your LXC/VM with Invidious. 
It would be great if your router would allow/do this by default, something like `invidious.lan` or even better `invidious.home.arpa`. For example, [OpenWrt](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/use-home-arpa-as-default-tld-for-local-network/165056/11) does this by default. For other routers, extra config might be needed.
If you have your own domain, reversed-proxy etc., setup might differ a bit for you...

Run this script (with sudo privileges or as root):
```
mkdir -p ~/invidious-podman && cd "$_" && git clone "https://github.com/SimplyProgrammer/Invidious-podman-LXC-VM.git" . && chmod 755 setup-invidious.sh && ./setup-invidious.sh
```
When it asks for the Invidious git repo, for 90% of you just press enter (unless you have your own forked one).

The most important part, when it asks for the DNS domain, specified aformentioned `invidious.lan`, `invidious.home.arpa` or whatever you have. But make sure the domain is reachable and working in advance (`nslookup` etc.).

If everything was done properly, now you should have a working LXC/VM with Invidious service and should be able to open it at `https://<your-invidious-domain>/`.
